# Blackjack

This repository contains the code to run a basic Blackjack game. The game operates through a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Pyside6 library. 

This is a basic version of the Blackjack game without betting. Cards are dealt to the user and the dealer through the *random.choice* method. The user will have the option to *hit* or to *stand*. 

A feature to be added in the future is the option for ace cards to be considered as a 1 or an 11. Also to be added is the option for the user to double down.

This program can be run using *python main.py* in the terminal.
