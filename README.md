# Blackjack

This repository contains the code to run a basic Blackjack game. The game operates through a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Pyside6 library. 

This is a basic version of the Blackjack game without betting. Cards are dealt to the user and the dealer through the *random.choice* method. The user will have the option to *hit* or to *stand*.

The game was updated to include a *double down* option as well. A feature to be added in the future is the *split* option if duplicate cards are dealt.

This program can be run using *python main.py* in the terminal.
